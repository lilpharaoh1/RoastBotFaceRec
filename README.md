This is a continuation of a previous project, DiscordRoastBot.
RoastBotFaceRec detects the faces and compares them to faces in the "faces" folder.
It can then cater insults to the specific people it detects.
The standard insults are collected with some simple webscrapping code.

No offense intended...
